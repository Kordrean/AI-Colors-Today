Project Name: Daily Color Analysis with ChatGPT

Description:
The Daily Color Analysis project aims to create a program that interacts with the ChatGPT language model daily to inquire about the color that best describes each day. The responses provided by ChatGPT will be stored in a database and visualized through a graphical user interface (GUI) as a rainbow gradient representing the spectrum of colors over time. Users will be able to hover over specific dates on the gradient to retrieve the reasons behind ChatGPT's color choices for that particular day.

Features:

    Daily interaction with ChatGPT to inquire about the color that best describes each day.
    Storage of color responses in a database for future analysis.
    Visualization of color choices through a rainbow gradient GUI.
    Ability for users to hover over specific dates to view the reasons behind ChatGPT's color choices.

Usage:

    Upon running the program, the GUI will be displayed.
    The program will interact with ChatGPT daily to inquire about the color that best describes each day.
    ChatGPT's responses will be stored in the database and visualized as a rainbow gradient on the GUI.
    Users can hover over specific dates on the gradient to view the reasons behind ChatGPT's color choices for that day.
